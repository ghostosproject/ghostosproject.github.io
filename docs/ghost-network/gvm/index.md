### Ghost Virtual Machine (GVM)

The Ghost Virtual Machine is at the center of The Ghost Network. At it's core, it is a simple WebAssembly Virutal Machine. In reality, it is an incredible machine that, when used to it's fullest, has amazing potential. 

GVM is still in its infancy, but when combined with GPMD and other GVM Nodes, it creates a network of very useful primatives for building useful software.

##### How Does GVM Work?
GVM can be started simply by running the "gvm" command in your terminal. GVM is created with a unique name and id for identification within the network.

```
$: gvm
GVM has been created node-5488 (217acd5a-63b4-44d4-9245-445509f7df02)
(node-5488) >
```

When starting a GVM it automatically tries to create a connection with GPMD on the local device. 

***Connecting to another node***
***Running WASM Modules***
